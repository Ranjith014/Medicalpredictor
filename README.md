Medical Predictor
https://huggingface.co/spaces/ran014/MedPredict

A powerful and intuitive application to predict medical diagnoses based on input data. This tool is designed to assist healthcare professionals by providing data-driven insights.
This project appears to be a medical prediction application developed in Python. Based on the file structure, it includes source code, tests, and key application files for making diagnoses.
Key Features
Accurate Predictions: Leverages machine learning models to provide reliable diagnostic predictions.
Modular and Organized Code: A clean and maintainable codebase with separate directories for source code and tests.
Easy to Use: Straightforward setup and execution for quick implementation.
Comprehensive Testing: Includes a suite of tests to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the models.
